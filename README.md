  Wiktionary page, etc.

## Installation

   - [Deno](https://deno.land/) (1.32+)
   - an internet connection (for the backend to fetch the pronunciations)

2. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Ascor8522/dutch-ipa.git

3. Set the environment variables:

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values.

   Leave the `DENO_KV_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable empty if you want to use your local

## FAQ

### There is sometimes a thinking emoji (ðŸ¤”) in the IPA transcription

> This means that no IPA transcription has been found for the corresponding word.

### There are errors in the IPA transcription

> This is because of how the source of data we use works.
> When a verb is conjugated, or when a word is in its plural form,
> the source redirects to the base form of the word.
>
> I am aware of this and am working on a solution.

### What source of data do you use?

> For the IPA:
>
> - Dutch:
> - [Woorden.org](https://www.woorden.org/)
> - [woordenlijst.org](https://www.woordenlijst.org/) (planned)
> - [Dutch Wiktionary](https://nl.wiktionary.org/) (planned, as backup)
> For the translation:
> - [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)
> For the Pronunciation:
> - [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)

### Are you going to add more languages?

> No, this project was mainly made for Dutch; tho it is technically possible
> and quite easy to add more languages.
