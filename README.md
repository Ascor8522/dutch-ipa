## FAQ

### There is sometimes a thinking emoji (ðŸ¤”) in the IPA transcription

> This means that no IPA transcription has been found for the corresponding word.

### There are errors in the IPA transcription

> This is because of how the source of data we use works. When a verb is conjugated, or when a word is in plural, the source redirects to the base form of the word.
>
> I am aware of this and am working on a solution.

### What source of data do you use?
